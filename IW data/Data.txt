what we have:

1. water system: supply water temperature, return water temperature, flow rate------can caculate load/energy consumption???(how to get EUI?)

2. air syetem():dry bulb control temp, dew bulb control temp

3. lighting:no data

4. IEQ:outdoor air temp, indoor air temp(avg&each zone), RH(avg&each zone), CO2(each zone)


Enegy: Cooling/heating demand(what's the unit?)

what we want:

1. secmo SA,RA,OA,flowrate?
2. avg co2?
3. energy(heating, cooling) consumption data?
4. dry bulb control temp, dew bulb control temp useful or not?
5. illuminance?
